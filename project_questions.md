# 1. Dataset and Problem Understanding
1. Why was the California Housing dataset chosen for this project?
   - It's a well-known benchmark dataset for regression problems
   - It contains real-world housing data with multiple features
   - It's suitable for demonstrating SVR's capabilities with continuous target variables
   - It's readily available in scikit-learn, making it easy to work with

2. What specific problem are we trying to solve with this dataset?
   - Predicting median house values in California districts based on various features like location, population, income, etc.

3. What are the key features in the dataset and how do they relate to housing prices?
   - MedInc: Median income in block group
   - HouseAge: Median house age in block group
   - AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household
   - AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household
   - Population: Block group population
   - AveOccup: Average number of household members
   - Latitude: Block group latitude
   - Longitude: Block group longitude

4. Are there any data quality issues or missing values that need to be addressed?
   - The dataset is pre-processed and clean, with no missing values, making it ideal for demonstrating machine learning concepts.

# 2. Model Selection and Implementation
1. Why was Support Vector Regression (SVR) chosen over other regression models?
   - It's effective for non-linear regression problems
   - It's robust to outliers
   - It can handle high-dimensional data well
   - It provides good generalization capabilities

2. What is the significance of the chosen hyperparameters (C=100, gamma=0.1, epsilon=0.1)?
   - C=100: Balances between margin maximization and error minimization
   - gamma=0.1: Controls the influence of each training example
   - epsilon=0.1: Defines the margin of tolerance where no penalty is given to errors

3. How does the RBF kernel contribute to the model's performance?
   - Captures non-linear relationships between features
   - Provides flexibility in decision boundary shape
   - Handles complex patterns in the housing data

4. What other regression models could be compared with SVR for this problem?
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regression
   - Gradient Boosting Regression
   - Neural Networks

# 3. Model Performance and Evaluation
1. Are the current performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) satisfactory for the problem?
   - The metrics are calculated but not shown in the current output
   - They should be compared against baseline models
   - The acceptable range depends on the business requirements

2. How do these metrics compare to baseline models or industry standards?
   - Should be compared to:
     - Simple baseline models (e.g., mean prediction)
     - Other regression models
     - Industry standards for housing price prediction

3. What are the limitations of the current model?
   - No hyperparameter tuning shown
   - No cross-validation implemented
   - No feature selection process
   - No handling of potential outliers

4. How could the model's performance be improved?
   - Implementing hyperparameter tuning
   - Adding feature engineering
   - Using cross-validation
   - Trying different kernels
   - Implementing ensemble methods

# 4. Feature Engineering and Preprocessing
1. Why was StandardScaler chosen for feature scaling?
   - Standardizes features to have zero mean and unit variance
   - SVR is sensitive to feature scales
   - Helps the model converge faster
   - Improves model performance

2. Are there any feature engineering techniques that could improve the model?
   - Creating interaction terms
   - Adding polynomial features
   - Creating location-based features
   - Adding demographic ratios

3. How do the feature importances align with domain knowledge about housing prices?
   - Feature importances should be analyzed to:
     - Validate domain knowledge
     - Identify key predictors
     - Guide feature engineering
     - Remove irrelevant features

4. Should any features be removed or transformed differently?
   - Consider:
     - Log transformations for skewed features
     - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
     - Creating composite features
     - Handling outliers
